      <h2 class="section-title">My App Design</h2>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        CardioFit focuses on cardio exercises. I felt that since there are many
        fitness apps that are geared towards general exercise, it would be awesome
        to design an app for the most important muscle in the body.
      </p>
      <img class="design-img" src="images/designpic1.png" alt="app-design">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        The first stage of the app is the onboarding experience. The user can easily sign in,
        or sign up.
      </p>
      <img class="design-img" src="images/designpic2.png" alt="app-design">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        The home screen is where various cardio exercises, or sessions, are displayed.
        Here users can start their heart fitness journeys.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        In the 'Badges' page is where users can see their completed sessions which
        earned them a badge. Badges come in the shape of a heart.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Not only does CardioFit serve as a fitness app, but it also incorporates user interactions,
        thus having a social media feel to it. The post button allows the user to post fitness updates,
        advice, ETC.
      </p>
      <img class="design-img" src="images/designpic3.png" alt="app-design">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        On the 'Tracker' page is where users can track their progress.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        If a user wants to find people they know, or simply look for more friends
        to follow, then the last page is where they would go.
      </p>
      <img class="design-img" src="images/designpic4.png" alt="app-design">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        I designed CardioFit to be simple, yet still aesthetically pleasing.
        It would be very easy for users to navigate, and that is definitely crucial
        when making an app with a clear goal in mind, to improve people's lives.
